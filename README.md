# A React Native drum loop / metronome app

## INTRODUCTION

My main reason for writing this app has been to consolidate my React Native skills by implementing and publishing a fairly challenging mobile app.

### WHAT DOES IT DO?

Percuss is fundamentally a straightforward metronome app (for non-musicians it basically marks time).

The difference between this and other metronome apps is that instead of playing a single beat the user can define a whole drum loop to play instead.

As far as I am able to ascertain, there is no other app in the app store offering this level of functionality - whether there needed to be I leave you to decide :grin:

The app is at its most effective by the way when the phone is connected to a speaker!
