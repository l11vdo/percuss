PERCUSS

Percuss is a practise tool for musicians. It can be regarded as a primitive drum machine or a fancy metronome - you decide!

Features:

BPM Dial - allows you to select the speed your drum loop will play at.

Pattern designer - allows you to pick from a number of possible beats and define where the beat will play within the pattern.

NB you can set a beat to play on the whole, half or quarter beat.

There are 3 tabs to help you design and play a drum pattern:

Play
  Mode:
    Loop - play the pattern over and over again
    One Time - play the pattern once
  Pattern:
    Pick the pattern you wish to play
  Play / Pause button

Compose
  Used in combination with the Pattern Designer - select the position where you want a beat to play in the Pattern designer then select the sound
  Play Beat button plays the beat once

Define
  Here you can change the drum kit, and number of beats for the currently loaded pattern (disabled for the samples we supply)
  You can also create a new drum pattern here

What's next?

This is a first release of the tool - I will continue to evolve the functionality if there are sufficient downloads and feedback / comments

Techy stuff

This tool is written entirely in React Native - there is no operating system specific (native) code.
Initial release will be on Android only - I will test then publish the IOS version shortly.

I hope you have lots of fun with this - please leave feedback / questions and lots of Stars in the app store!`
